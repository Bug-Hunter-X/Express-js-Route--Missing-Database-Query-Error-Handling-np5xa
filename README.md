# Express.js Route: Missing Database Query Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting to handle potential errors during database queries within route handlers.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where a database query's failure results in a silent error, potentially causing unexpected behavior or application crashes.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code with proper error handling using `try...catch` blocks to gracefully manage exceptions and return appropriate error responses to the client.
